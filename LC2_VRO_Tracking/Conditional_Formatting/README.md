## Using Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting is a powerful tool that allows you to change the color or behavior of cells based on specific information or conditions. This feature can help minimize user errors and streamline data entry. In this project, we utilize conditional formatting to enhance data accuracy.

### How to Access Conditional Formatting

There are two ways to access the conditional formatting options:

1. **Method 1:** From the "FORMAT" menu:
   - Click on "FORMAT" in the menu bar.
   - Choose "CONDITIONAL FORMATTING" from the dropdown menu.

2. **Method 2:** Right-click on a cell:
   - Right-click on the cell you want to apply conditional formatting to.
   - Select "CONDITIONAL FORMATTING" from the context menu.

### Purpose and Benefits

The primary goal of using conditional formatting in this project is to eliminate user errors and ensure the accuracy of data entered. For example, if a user skips filling in the date or shift, the LC2 VRO TIMES page may not register the order correctly. To prevent such issues, we've set up conditional formatting rules.

### Implementation Example

- **Bright Red Cell:** If a cell is skipped (e.g., date or shift not entered), the cell will turn bright red. This immediate visual cue alerts users to fill in the required information.

- **Comments in Column M:** Column M contains comments that instruct the LC2 VRO TIMES page. If an order should be disregarded, these comments indicate it. The conditional formatting system also shades out unnecessary cells based on these comments, reducing confusion and ensuring operators only focus on relevant entries.

### Conclusion

By utilizing conditional formatting, we enhance data integrity, streamline operations, and minimize the chance of errors. This contributes to a smoother workflow and more accurate records.
