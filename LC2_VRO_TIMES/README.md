This Sheet is mostly self sufficient.

The Page does need opened daily. The sheets are created, formatted, and hidden on page open. 

*IMPORTANT*
There is a 5 million character limit on Google Sheets. The Page creation will cease to work and throw an error when reached.
If reached you should: 
  1. Make sure that the APU graphs are no longer pulling from these sheets directily. You can do this by RIGHT CLICK -> COPY -> PASTE VALUES.
     This will delete the underlying code but keep its value
  2. Delete old sheets
