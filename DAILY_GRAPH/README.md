## Formula-Based Cell Dependencies

In this project, the values in certain cells are dynamically calculated based on values from other cells. This allows for automation and consistency, reducing manual input and potential errors.

### Setting B30 to the 1st of the Current Month

- **Cell B30:**
  - Purpose: Cell B30 serves as a reference point for other dates in the sheet.
  - Current Value: The current value of B30 determines the starting date for the calculations.
  - Default: B30 is set to the 1st of the current month.
  - Note: Modifying B30 will automatically update the dates of all cells that rely on it.

This means that altering the value in B30 to a different date will cascade through the rest of the sheet, updating all dependent dates accordingly. By ensuring B30 is set to the 1st of the current month, you maintain a consistent and accurate baseline for your calculations.
