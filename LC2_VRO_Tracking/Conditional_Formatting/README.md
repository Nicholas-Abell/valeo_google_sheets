To access: FORMAT -> CONDITIONAL FORMATTING or RIGHT CLICK -> CONDITIONAL FORMATTING

This is used to change the color or behavior of a cell based on set information.

These is mostly to help eliminate user error. If the user was to skip the date or shift the LC2 VRO TIMES page would not register the order, 
so the cell will be bright red if skipped.
Comments in column M let the LC2 VRO TIMES page know to disregard the order, and will shade out all cells unnecessary to be filled by the operator.
